# Cogwheels
**Cogwheels** is a work-in-progress configuration-loading library for Ruby.

## Installation
To install, use the standard RubyGems syntax:
```sh
$ gem install cogwheels
```
Or if necessary, you can add it to your `Gemfile`:
```rb
gem 'cogwheels'
```
As **Cogwheels** is not yet at version `1.0`, it is recommended to use version locking:
```rb
gem 'cogwheels', '~> 0.1'
```
